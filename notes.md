SDLC - > Software Development life cycle 
-> Gather Requirements 
-> Design 
-> Code 
-> Testing
-> Deploy 
-> Maintain

Here,  Devops focuses on what user never see -> all the behind the process of the project or particular product/app.

1. Devops :
It is the process of buliding or deploying , testing the applications continously.Basically if we deploy and test the code on the sameday we can get maximum feedback lifecycles to improve our product before delivering it to the end user. We use multiple tools to make the process smooth.Contionus Integreation, Continous Deployment , delivery , testing , monitoring , application security are always part of Devops Practices. Code and Infra should be always same across environment.

Here, environment are (staging -> testing -> pre-production -> production envs) . In IT industry, the companies may differ about pre-production, atleast they will have staging -> testing -> production. For extensive applications, they may incerase the envs , for the better performance of application for users. 

The major primary goal or repsonsiblity of Devops Engineer is "AUTOMATION".


Let's look into the Architecture :-

-> Look it as framework that mixes development and operation practices, which helps us to    create a smoother, more cooperative and effcient way to deliver the software.

-> Here, we breakdown barriers between the teams and where we intergrate different steps fof software development life cycle.This helps improve communication, automation, and constant improvement.
